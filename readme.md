# Astro Commander
Astro Commander (working title) is an open-source (MIT) roguelike with probably vagually similar gameplay to FTL, although I have never actually played that game.  You control the crew of a ship and must try and avoid getting destroyed while going on an adventure.

##RUNNING
You will need Java to run it.


##HINTS
* Enter '?' for help.  Use numbers to select units, and arrow keys to move them.  Other controls are given in the game.
* Log into the Control Panel.
* Hail the space station at the start.


##STATUS
It works, but there's not much to it yet, and has not been thoroughly balanced.  And it probably has a few bugs.
